consent_ui_welcome = """Greetings from the KOI Ethnography Research Team! We are exploring how Metagov uses and governs its Knowledge Organization Infrastructure (or KOI). You can learn more about our research [here](https://brookeanncoco.substack.com/p/an-ethnography-of-metagovs-koi-initiative). You are receiving this notice because one of your messages has been tagged for observation.

We’d like your permission to quote you in our research. Here’s how it works:
- **Your decision to opt in or out will apply to this message and all future messages observed by Telescope.** 
- If you opt in, **you will be notified whenever new messages are observed,** and you will have the option to retract them. Retracted messages will be removed from the ethnographic dataset.
- Messages can be **automatically retracted via the Telescope bot for up to four weeks** after being added to the ethnographic dataset. After this period, individuals must contact @Brooke Ann Coco directly via DM to retract messages.
- You may **withdraw your consent entirely at any time,** in which case none of your posts will be quoted in future research publications. 
- Additional information regarding the role and rights of ethnographic research participants can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/29fs3374ixbfbqkjobt4j/KOI_PISCF_v2.docx?rlkey=z1wsu6rjgn2qj7lv5l8r3vqjw&st=p3llut7a&dl=0).

**Note:** This consent is for the ethnographic research only. Metagov has a separate [data use policy](https://metagov.pubpub.org/pub/data-policy/release/10) regarding its use of Slack messages.

Do you consent to participate in the research and allow your tagged posts to be included in the ethnographic data?

A) ✅ Opt in: Yes, you may quote my posts and attribute them to my Slack Handle.
B) ⚠️ Opt in (anonymously): Yes, you may quote my posts anonymously, but do not use my Slack handle or any other identifying information.
C) ❌ Opt out: No, you may not quote my posts in your research."""
