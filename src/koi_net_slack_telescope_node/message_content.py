consent_ui_welcome = """Greetings from the KOI Ethnography Research Team! We are exploring how Knowledge Organization Infrastructure (or KOI) is used and governed. You are receiving this notice because one of your messages has been tagged for observation.

We’d like your permission to quote you in our research. Here’s how it works:
 - *Your decision to opt in or out will apply to this message and all future messages observed by Telescope.* 
 - If you opt in, *you will be notified whenever new messages are observed,* and you will have the option to retract them. Retracted messages will be removed from the ethnographic dataset.
 - Messages can be *automatically retracted via the Telescope bot for up to four weeks* after being added to the ethnographic dataset. After this period, individuals must contact the researchers directly via DM to retract messages.
 - You may *withdraw your consent entirely at any time,* in which case none of your posts will be quoted in future research publications. 


*Note:* This consent is for the ethnographic research only.

Do you consent to participate in the research and allow your tagged posts to be included in the ethnographic data?

A) ✅ Opt in: Yes, you may quote my posts and attribute them to my Slack Handle.
B) ⚠️ Opt in (anonymously): Yes, you may quote my posts anonymously, but do not use my Slack handle or any other identifying information.
C) ❌ Opt out: No, you may not quote my posts in your research."""
